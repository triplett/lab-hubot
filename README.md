# hubot

hubot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was initially
generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be deployed
on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

## Deployment
